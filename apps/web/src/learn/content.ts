- **System instructions:** the orchestrator's rules, such as "Salesforce tool results are the only authority" and "never claim a write happened".
- **Tool definitions:** names, descriptions, and JSON input schemas for every tool the model may call on this step.
- **Conversation messages:** the recent user and assistant messages.
- **Tool results:** what each tool returned earlier in this turn.

**Context engineering** is deciding what goes into that window, in what form, and what stays out. More is not better. Long, noisy windows dilute attention ("context rot"), cost more, and give stale or injected text a chance to steer the model. Good context is the *smallest* set of high-signal information that lets the model do the next step well.`,

|---|---|---|---|

| **Audit trail** | What each turn did: route, tools, inputs and outputs, outcome | Agent SQLite (turn history) | 24 hours |
| **Long-term memory** | Drafts you asked to remember and confirmed Salesforce writes | Knowledge graph, linked to the campaigns and brands involved | 14 days, across chats |

**Working memory** is sent to the model as a bounded window: the last 8 messages. Earlier assistant replies are reduced to their text, so old tool results and reasoning never re-enter the prompt. The workspace is working memory too. The draft being built, the records the chat opened, and the context its tools gathered are summarized in every prompt, so the model works from structured state instead of re-reading old replies. See *The workspace* under the demo concepts.

**The audit trail** is never sent to the model. It exists for people: the History view and the audit export.

**Long-term memory** belongs in the graph because it's retrieved *by relationship* ("what did we decide about the Coastline push?"), not by recency, and it needs provenance. It's never sent automatically: the model reads it through recall tools, only when a question asks about earlier work. See *Long-term memory* under the demo concepts.`,

Defense: earlier replies are *context, not evidence*. The system prompt requires re-checking Salesforce facts with tools each turn, and old tool results are stripped from history.

**Prompt injection.** Text inside data, such as a campaign description saying "ignore previous instructions", can try to steer the model. Defenses:
- The model has **no write tools**; writes need a human confirmation.
- A **policy router** answers write and forbidden requests without calling the model.
- Tool results are treated as data.
- The Apex readiness check flags instruction-like text.

**Overflow and truncation.** Workers AI defaults to 256 output tokens, which gpt-oss's reasoning could use up before any answer. Defenses: an explicit 4,096-token budget, forced text-only summary steps, and a recovery message if a turn still ends empty.`,

2. **Augment.** Put those pieces into the model's context with the question.
3. **Generate.** The model answers from the retrieved facts instead of its training data.

RAG is excellent for "find the passage that answers this". It struggles when the answer depends on **connections** between facts spread across many documents. For example: *which accounts engaged with content from two campaigns and also lack SMS consent?* Similarity search finds similar text; it doesn't join facts.

In this demo, tool calls are a form of retrieval: the Salesforce agents and the graph tools fetch facts at answer time.`,

There are several common patterns:

- **Curated graph queries** (used here): the model picks from fixed, parameterized queries such as *explain buyer group*. This is predictable, safe, fast, and easy to evaluate.
- **Text-to-Cypher:** the model writes graph queries itself. It's flexible, but riskier and harder to govern.
- **Hybrid vector + graph:** vector search finds entry points, then graph traversal expands to connected context.
- **Community summaries:** Microsoft's GraphRAG clusters the graph into communities and pre-summarizes them to answer global "what are the themes?" questions.

GraphRAG's advantages are **multi-hop reasoning** and **explainability**. Every answer can carry the path that justifies it, which the demo shows in the **Graph evidence** panel.`,

Its campaigns run on the **mobile app** channel, and each of its 1,500 past push sends links to its campaign, push content, app segment, push consent, location, daypart, weather, and featured menu item.
- **The store:** Neo4j AuraDB, reached over the HTTPS **Query API**, because Workers can't open Bolt connections. Every tool query runs in **read access mode**, so the database itself rejects writes. The only writes are the server's fixed long-term memory statements, which keep to their own dataset.
- **The tools:** \`explain_buyer_group\`, \`find_audience_overlap\`, \`check_consent_coverage\`, \`find_similar_past_pushes\`, \`trace_content_lineage\`, \`get_graph_overview\`, and three that power the sales and service use cases: \`plan_account_outreach\`, \`assess_location_impact\`, and \`map_weather_demand\`. Each returns an answer plus up to 25 **evidence paths**.
- **Parity:** every tool also has an in-memory implementation over the same dataset. \`pnpm kg:parity\` proves both return identical results, so local development and evals match production. It also reports tool latency; the median stays under 500 ms.
- **Grounding:** evaluations check that a graph answer names only accounts, people, campaigns, and menu items that appear in what the tools returned.
- **In a flow:** the restaurant push campaign calls \`find_similar_past_pushes\` to learn what worked before in the same weather and daypart, then passes that to the Salesforce content tool.`,

        body: `The **orchestrator** is a Cloudflare **Agents SDK** chat agent running in a **Durable Object**: a single-threaded, stateful instance with its own SQLite storage.
- Each user gets their own instance, keyed by a hash of their Access identity and the workspace, so conversations and history are isolated by construction.
- Each turn streams to the browser over a WebSocket, and the stream is **resumable** if the tab reconnects.

A turn runs a **tool loop** of up to 6 steps. On each step the model either calls a tool or writes the answer. Its tools come from four MCP servers, connected per turn: Salesforce, campaign context, the knowledge graph, and external services (public holidays and weather alerts). The orchestrator decides which tools are available on each step (see *Routing*) and records a **turn trace** of every event.

Around the loop, the orchestrator also handles the events the model must not: it prepares confirmed writes and, once you confirm, asks Marketing Cloud's Campaign Creation agent to save the brief or create the campaign, then reads the records back. It checks Salesforce before and after the agent call, so a retry links what an earlier attempt saved instead of saving it twice. When the model refines a saved brief's preview, the orchestrator adds the Brief ID to the request if the model left it out. While a confirmed write runs, it publishes each step as agent state, which the browser receives immediately over the WebSocket, so the progress is live rather than a spinner until the end. For an inventory check, it keeps the forecast, the graph's demand map, and the stock counts as they arrive, computes which items are low, and rebuilds the system prompt for the answer step so the model presents exactly that list. It writes **long-term memory** when a write is read back or you ask it to remember a draft, and it reopens a memory into the workspace when you choose **Reopen**. The Worker's hourly job prunes the 24-hour audit and deletes memory past its 14 days.`,

        body: `Each chat has a **working set**, shown in the Workspace panel and summarized in every prompt. It starts empty with **New chat** and has three parts:

- **Focus:** the draft being built as structured data: a title, labeled fields, a change note, and the context it was built from. A campaign's focus is the **brief** Marketing Cloud's Campaign Creation agent drafted, read field for field from the agent's reply (Key Message, Target Audience, Primary Goal, and so on). Other drafts, such as copy from the Content Builder agent, are read from the answer's labeled lines. Each revision becomes a new version, and earlier versions stay viewable. Once saved, the focus shows the brief's campaign preview and then the campaign and flow Salesforce read back.
- **Context:** cards for what tools returned, such as weather, forecasts, weather alerts, public holidays, store inventory, the inventory risk the workbench computed, the restaurant profile, graph evidence, remembered work recalled from memory, and Salesforce summaries, each with its source and fetch time.
- **Records:** records the chat opened, created, or updated, in any connected system, plus any reopened from memory, which are marked *Remembered* until the chat reads them again. Salesforce is one system and restaurant data is another; any system can join through the same reference: system, object type, and id.

Four properties make it trustworthy:

1. **Deterministic ingestion.** Cards and records come from tool results through code, never from model-written text, so nothing in the workspace is invented.
2. **Open versus available.** Records the connected systems make available are listed separately as a catalog, so the model never acts on a record the chat hasn't opened.
3. **Approvals come to you.** When something needs your approval, an **action card** appears in the chat: saving the brief in Marketing Cloud, then creating its campaign, or requesting a review after a readiness check. Accepting it prepares the confirmation card, with Salesforce's permission check.
4. **Writes act on what you see.** Saving asks the Campaign Creation agent to save exactly the focus version on screen. The confirmation records that version in its request hash, and the Brief, Campaign, and flow appear in Records as Salesforce read them back.`,

The demo uses four MCP servers:

| Server | Tools | How it's reached |
|---|---|---|
| **Salesforce Hosted MCP** | 14 governed tools backed by Agentforce agents and Apex actions | Remote, with per-user OAuth |
| **Campaign context** | Restaurant profile and store inventory (both mocked), and live weather and forecasts (Open-Meteo) | In-process; also at \`/mcp/campaign-context\` |

| **Knowledge graph** | Nine curated Neo4j queries, plus three memory recall tools in chat | In-process; also at \`/mcp/knowledge-graph\` |

The local servers are called **in-process** through an in-memory MCP transport. The orchestrator uses the real protocol without a network hop, and external MCP clients can still reach the same servers over HTTP, behind Cloudflare Access.`,

  - **Northstar Campaign Creation** (a Marketing Cloud Next Campaign Creation agent) drafts, saves, and refines briefs and creates campaigns and their flows. See *Marketing Cloud Next*.
  - **Northstar Content Builder** (a Marketing Cloud Next Content Builder agent) drafts copy and content sections with the standard Draft Content and Create Section actions.
  - **Northstar Account Discovery** uses Marketing's account discovery and scoring APIs for signals, engagement, and buyer groups.
  - **Campaign Readiness and Governance** is a custom agent whose Apex actions summarize a campaign and check readiness, consent, and brand rules. These stay custom on purpose: Marketing Cloud Next has no campaign-summary or readiness action, and its standard **Generate Campaign Insights** flow fails in this org until campaigns have sent and gathered engagement data.
- **Briefs and campaigns** are created only by the Campaign Creation agent's standard actions, as Marketing Cloud's own **Brief**, **BriefPlanStep**, **Campaign**, and campaign **flow** records. The workbench has no custom objects or Apex for them.

The model never holds a write tool: only the confirmation flow can call the write tools, and every write runs as you.

Metadata (Apex, fields, the permission set, and the MCP definition) deploys through a gated CI pipeline to one approved proof org.`,

          "The workbench asks Salesforce's Campaign Creation agent to create briefs and campaigns, the way the Marketing app does.",
        body: `In **Marketing Cloud Next**, a campaign starts as a **brief** and becomes a **campaign with a flow**. Salesforce's **Campaign Creation agent** does that work with standard actions, and the workbench asks it to rather than writing records itself.

**The agent.** \`Northstar_Campaign_Creation\` is an Agent Script agent built from Salesforce's \`MktCloud__CampaignCreationAgent\` template and published as a Campaign Creation agent. Only Agent Script agents can be exposed as Hosted MCP tools, so the workbench reaches it through the \`NorthstarMarketingWorkbench\` MCP server. Its **Marketing Campaigns** subagent runs the standard actions in Salesforce's required order:

| Step | Standard action | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Draft a Campaign Brief (\`MktCloud__GenerateBrief\`) | Drafts name, description, key message, audience, goal, CTAs, KPI, guardrails, and priority. Saves nothing. |
| 2 | Save Campaign Brief (\`saveBrief\`) | Creates the **Brief** record. |
| 3 | Draft a Campaign Preview (\`MktCloud__GenerateCampaignFromBrief\`) | Plans the messages as **BriefPlanStep** records on the brief: channel, wait, subject, preheader, and body. |
| 4 | Create Campaign (\`createCampaign\`) | Creates the **Campaign**, linked to the brief. |
| 5 | Save Campaign (\`MktCloud__SaveCampaign\`) | Builds the campaign's **flow** from the preview, as a draft. |

Its **Campaign Refinement** subagent runs **Refine Campaign Preview** to change a saved preview ("make the second email shorter").

**How the workbench uses it.**
1. A campaign request (the Coastline plan, or "create a campaign in Marketing Cloud") ends with \`draft_campaign_brief\`. The agent's brief becomes the workspace focus, field for field.
2. **Save brief** (an action card, then a confirmation card): \`save_marketing_brief\` asks the agent to run steps 2 and 3.
3. **Create the campaign** (a second card): \`create_marketing_campaign\` asks it to run steps 4 and 5.
4. After each write, \`get_marketing_records\` (read-only Apex) reads the Brief, its steps, the Campaign, and the flow back from Salesforce. The workspace shows only what Salesforce returned, never the agent's say-so.

**What stays in Marketing Cloud.** The flow is created as a draft. Choosing its audience and sender, and activating it, happen in Marketing Cloud; the workbench never sends or activates anything. Previews in this org plan email (and SMS) steps: a push request is recorded in the brief's guardrails.

**Safe to retry.** Marketing Cloud's save actions aren't idempotent, so the workbench checks Salesforce before asking the agent. If this exact save was sent before and never confirmed (say, it timed out after the agent saved), and Salesforce now shows that brief, the workbench links it instead of saving again; a brief with the same name from another chat is left alone. A brief that already has its campaign never gets a second one. If the agent call fails, it checks once more, since the agent may have saved before the timeout. Only when nothing is there does it ask you to try again.

**The server fills in what the agent needs.** When you change a saved brief, the workbench adds the Brief ID to the Refine Campaign Preview request if the model left it out. The model forgot it in half of the live evaluation runs, and the agent would otherwise have to guess which brief you meant.

**Each call is one request.** Hosted MCP agent tools take a single message, so each call carries everything the agent needs: the confirmed brief fields, or the Brief ID whose preview was confirmed. The agent is asked to include the record ids in its reply, and the read-back verifies them.`,

1. **Policy router.** "Remember this draft" is handled by the server, which stores the focus in long-term memory.

Other save, create, or change requests get a fixed reply pointing to the confirmation flow. Publish, send, delete, and similar requests are refused. None of these calls the model, so it can never claim a write happened.
2. **Intent router.** Clear intents force a **tool plan**: an ordered list of tools, one forced per step.
   - "Check readiness" → \`check_campaign_readiness\`
   - "Why is X in the buyer group?" → \`explain_buyer_group\`
   - "What did we decide about…?" or "last time…" → \`recall_decisions\`; "what have we worked on recently?" → \`recall_recent_work\`

   - Inventory, stock, or ingredients at a location → \`get_weather_forecast\` → \`map_weather_demand\` → \`get_location_inventory\`
   - A Coastline Kitchen email or push campaign → profile → weather → past pushes → the Campaign Creation agent's brief, which becomes the focus
   - "Create a campaign … in Salesforce" or "in Marketing Cloud" → the Campaign Creation agent's brief, then the save is prepared for confirmation
   - A change to a brief ("make it warmer") → back to the agent: a re-drafted brief before it's saved, or **Refine Campaign Preview** after
   - A change to other drafts → no tools; the model rewrites the draft, which is saved as the next version
   - The rules need specific signals and **defer to the model** when unsure, because a wrongly forced tool can't be undone within the turn.

- **A tool call written into reasoning or answer text.** The guard recovers the JSON arguments when they match the tool's schema, and hides leaked text from the user.
- **Channel markup or a dropped prefix in tool names**, such as \`summarize_campaign<|channel|>analysis\`. The guard repairs the name when exactly one real tool matches.
- **Arguments that aren't valid JSON.** The guard escapes raw newlines inside strings and reads \`<arg_key>\`/\`<arg_value>\` markup. Arguments cut off mid-call can't be repaired, so they count as no call.
- **No usable call at all.** The step is retried once.
- **A tool call in an answer step,** which offers no tools. The call is dropped; if it was all the step produced, the answer is retried once.
- **Runaway reasoning.** Forced steps are capped at 2,048 tokens. Reasoning counts against the cap, and a detailed request to a Salesforce agent can take several hundred tokens on its own.

        body: `The workbench can have Marketing Cloud's Campaign Creation agent save a brief and create its campaign and flow, and it can create a review task or attach an image. Every write follows the same flow:

1. **Plan:** the server builds the request from the draft in the workspace, so the values are exactly what you reviewed. A review task or image targets a campaign this chat opened from Salesforce, never one it only reopened from memory.
2. **Permission check:** before anything is prepared, the workbench asks Salesforce, **as you**, whether you may make this write: the workbench permission set, the Marketing User feature for campaigns, create or edit access on each object, field-level security, and edit access to the record for updates. The confirmation card lists every check. If one fails, nothing is prepared and the card says why.
3. **Confirmation:** the card shows what will be created, its values, the draft version, and, for briefs and campaigns, the Marketing Cloud agent and the standard actions it will run. It's bound by a SHA-256 request hash and a 5-minute expiry, and it can be used once.
4. **Execute:**
   - For a **brief or campaign**, the workbench asks the Campaign Creation agent, through its Hosted MCP tool, to run its standard actions. The agent runs as you, so Salesforce enforces your permissions as each action runs.
   - For a **review task, image, or inventory case**, the Worker signs the confirmation with HMAC. Apex verifies the signature, the expiry, the same user, and the hash, then writes in **user mode**. An inventory case's contents come from the Worker, so its request hash is the SHA-256 of exactly those contents, and Apex re-hashes what it receives before writing.
5. **Read-back:** the workbench reads the records back from Salesforce (\`get_marketing_records\` for Marketing Cloud) and shows only what Salesforce returned. If the agent says it saved something that Salesforce doesn't show, nothing is shown as saved.

You watch both halves step by step. While a confirmation is prepared, the steps are the plan, Salesforce's permission check with how many checks passed, and binding the request to a one-time confirmation. While a confirmed write runs, they're the confirmation check, a look for an earlier attempt or the signing, the call to the agent or the Apex action, the read-back, and the memory record. A failure marks the step where it stopped and says why.

**Who checks what.** Each layer does one job:

| Layer | Responsible for | Not responsible for |
|---|---|---|
| **The model** | Drafting and proposing saves | Writing anything: it has no write tools |
| **The workbench** | Planning the request from your draft, asking Salesforce for a permission check, hashing, reading back | Deciding who may write, or creating briefs and campaigns itself |
| **The Marketing Cloud agent** | Running Marketing Cloud's standard actions for briefs, previews, campaigns, and flows | Deciding what to save: it saves what you confirmed |
| **You** | Reviewing exact values and confirming | — |
| **Salesforce** | Authorization (profile, permission sets, field-level security, sharing), signature checks for Apex writes, the records, and read-back | — |

**Kill switches** (\`WRITES_ENABLED\`, \`DISABLED_TOOLS\`, \`MEMORY_ENABLED\`) are Worker secrets that operators can flip without a deploy. Graph tools read in read-only mode; only the server's fixed memory statements write, and only to the memory dataset. The external-services tools only read public data (holidays and weather alerts) and send nothing about customers. No customer PII enters prompts, logs, or the graph.`,

Drafted scenarios that aren't built yet are shown greyed out as *Coming soon*.

Two use cases take the same pattern beyond marketing. Each pairs a new free public API with the knowledge graph, and **the graph supplies the key element**.

**Sales: buyer-group outreach around local holidays.** "Plan outreach to Acme Outfitters' buyer group for the next month."
1. \`plan_account_outreach\` walks the graph from the account to its buying-role personas. For each person it returns their engagement, when they last engaged, and **the channels they have marketing consent for**, following Persona → HAS_CONSENT → ConsentScope → FOR → Channel. It also returns the account's headquarters country.
2. \`get_public_holidays\` asks **Nager.Date** for that country's upcoming public holidays.
3. The answer is a prioritized, dated plan that uses only consented channels and avoids the holidays. Nothing is sent or logged.

**Service: severe-weather customer impact.** "There are weather alerts near our San Diego location. Which customers are affected and what should we tell them?"
1. \`get_weather_alerts\` asks the **National Weather Service** for active watches, warnings, and advisories at the restaurant's coordinates. If there are none there, it lists alerts elsewhere in California.
2. \`assess_location_impact\` walks Location ← Segment → push consent and Campaign → TARGETS → Segment. It returns how many app users are near the location, how many can be notified under their consent, and which active campaigns target them and should be paused. The counts are aggregate; no individual customer is named.
3. The answer is an impact summary, a drafted customer notice, and a note for the store team. Nothing is sent or paused.

Both APIs are free and keyless, called live from the Worker through a new in-process **external services** MCP server. An API failure comes back as a tool error, and the answer says so instead of guessing.

**Service: weather-driven inventory check, with a case for the store manager.** "Check inventory for our Sacramento store against the forecast."
1. \`get_weather_forecast\` reads the daily **Open-Meteo** forecast and buckets each day for demand planning: **heat** for highs of 88°F or more, **rain** for wet days, otherwise fog, cloudy, or clear.
2. \`map_weather_demand\` walks WeatherCondition → **LIFTS_DEMAND** → MenuItem → **MADE_WITH** → InventoryItem, plus Location → **MANAGED_BY** → StoreManager. Each lift is learned from past push results: a dish's average order rate under that weather against its overall average, kept when it's at least 15% higher. Heat lifts the cold drinks and açaí bowl; rain and fog lift soup, noodles, and the burrito.
3. \`get_location_inventory\` reads the restaurant's stock from the **store inventory system**. In this demo it's a randomized mock that's stable within a day: on hand, par level, and typical daily use per item.
4. **Code, not the model, decides what's low.** For each weather-lifted item, the forecast need is typical daily use on each day, raised by the lift on the days whose weather lifts a dish made with it. An item is low when what's on hand won't cover that. The result becomes an **Inventory risk** card and an **action card**, and the answer step is told exactly this list.
5. Accepting the card prepares a **Salesforce case** for the store manager. The case contents are hashed, the hash becomes the confirmation's request hash, and after you confirm, the \`create_inventory_case\` Apex action re-hashes what it received and refuses anything that doesn't match. It then finds the manager's Contact by title and restaurant, creates the Case as you, and reads it back.

The graph and prompts carry the manager's name only, never contact details. Nothing is ordered.`,

        summary:
          "Drafts and decisions stored in the graph by the server, recalled by tools, and forgotten on request.",
        body: `A new chat starts with an empty workspace, but some work should outlive it: the draft you settled on, the campaign you saved, the review you asked for. **Long-term memory** keeps these in the knowledge graph for 14 days, shared by the workspace.

**What gets remembered, and by whom.** The model never writes memory. The server does, only on events it has verified:
- a Salesforce save, review task, or image attachment that you confirmed and Salesforce read back
- a request to remember the draft in focus: say "remember this draft", or use **History → Memory**

**How it's stored.** Each memory is a small subgraph in its own dataset, next to the demo graph:
- a \`Draft\` node per version, linked to the version it replaced (\`SUPERSEDES\`)
- a \`Decision\` node, linked to the draft it saved (\`DECIDED_ON\`) and the Salesforce record it created (\`RECORDED_IN\`)
- \`ABOUT\` links to the \`Campaign\` and \`Brand\` nodes involved, so "what did we decide about Coastline?" is a graph question

Every node carries its workspace and an expiry. The person who acted is stored only as a hash.

**How it's recalled.** When you ask about earlier work ("what did we decide…", "last time…", "what have we worked on recently?"), the intent router forces a recall tool:
- \`recall_decisions\`
- \`recall_recent_work\`
- \`explain_memory\`

The server gives these tools the workspace, so the model can't read another workspace's memory. Each item comes back **dated and sourced**, with provenance paths, and the model is told to treat it as past work and re-check Salesforce before reusing it.

**How it's reopened.** **Reopen** in the Memory tab puts remembered work back into the current chat:
- A remembered draft becomes the focus again, at its remembered version, with a note saying where it came from.
- For a decision, its draft becomes the focus.
- The records it links to join **Records**, marked *Remembered*.

Memory may be stale, so reopening never marks a draft as saved, and a remembered campaign isn't a write target. The chat has to read it from Salesforce again first. Only you can reopen memory; the model can't.

**How it's forgotten.** **Forget** in the Memory tab deletes an item at once, and the audit export records it. An hourly job deletes anything past 14 days. \`MEMORY_ENABLED=false\` turns memory off entirely.`,
