/**
 * Which source paths each Learn section explains. `pnpm learn:check` uses this map in two ways:
 *
 * - **Drift:** when a change touches a mapped path, the sections that explain it must change in
 *   the same branch, or a commit must carry `Learn-Reviewed: <section ids> (<why no update>)`.
 * - **New concepts:** every source file must be mapped to a section here or listed as untaught
 *   below, so a new module can't land without someone deciding where it's taught.
 *
 * Entries are path prefixes: a directory ends with "/", and anything else is a file.
